I am an engineer working with Samsung Semiconductors Research India (SSIR), Bangalore. I primarily work on developing C-models and algorithms for CMOS Image Sensors.

I have finished my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal (NITK). I had pleasure working with Dr. Raghavendra BS there.

At Samsung Semiconductors Research India, I am blessed to work on CMOS Image Sensor algorithm and C-model development. I have contributed towards development of the low-power motion detection algorithm. It resulted in one-of-the-first low-cost image sensors supporting motion detection.

### Transliteration of Hindi Sign Boards to English
Indic languages are written in a variety of scripts (Brahmi family of abugida scripts, Arabic-derived abjad scripts, and even alphabetic Roman script). This diversity makes it challenging to support mechanisms which are convenient for typing or creating content in these diverse languages and scripts. Most Indian users are comfortable with the Roman keyboard and thus an optimal solution that users find beneficial is automatic transliteration of the romanized input into the native script.
