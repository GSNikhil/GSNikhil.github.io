This interactive music game designed for children incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a delightful experience. Each keyboard key corresponds to a unique piece of music and triggers a corresponding animation when pressed. By engaging with this game, kids can explore different musical sounds and enjoy the visual feedback provided <!--more--> by the animations. This project allowed me to enhance my front-end web development skills by working with HTML for structuring the game interface, CSS for styling the elements and animations, and JavaScript for handling key presses and playing the music. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to foster creativity and provide an enjoyable learning experience for young users.
