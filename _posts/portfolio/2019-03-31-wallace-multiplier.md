I successfully designed and validated a 4-bit Wallace multiplier utilizing the software tool Magic. This project allowed me to gain valuable skills in digital circuit design and verification. With Magic, I was able to create a schematic representation of the multiplier, implementing the necessary logic gates and interconnections. <!--more-->Through simulation and verification, I ensured the correctness and functionality of the design. This project enhanced my understanding of complex multiplication algorithms, circuit synthesis, and layout design. Additionally, I learned to effectively utilize Magic as a tool for designing and validating digital circuits, paving the way for further exploration in the field of integrated circuit design.
