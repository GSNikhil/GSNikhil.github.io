By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a straightforward to-do list. This project enabled me to organize and manage my tasks efficiently (for a few days xD). The HTML is employed for structuring the list and creating the user interface. CSS allowed me to style the list, enhancing its visual appeal and <!--more--> user experience. JavaScript empowered me to add functionality such as adding and removing tasks dynamically, marking tasks as completed, and storing data locally. Through this project, I enhanced my front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also improving my ability to design intuitive user interfaces and handle user interactions effectively.
