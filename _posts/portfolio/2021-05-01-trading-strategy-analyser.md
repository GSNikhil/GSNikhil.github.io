I employed Python and Zerodha APIs to gather data and evaluate the profitability of a trading strategy for the top 50 stocks in the Indian Stock Market based on their <!--more-->market capitalization (NIFTY50). By developing this script, I gained valuable skills in data retrieval and analysis using APIs. Python allowed me to efficiently retrieve the required data and perform calculations to assess the profitability of the trading strategy. The script further provided insights by indicating the profit or loss for each trade. This project enhanced my understanding of financial markets, data manipulation, and analysis, while also strengthening my programming skills in Python.
