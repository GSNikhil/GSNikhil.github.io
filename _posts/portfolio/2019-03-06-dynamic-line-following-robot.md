I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables users to draw paths. This project allowed me to enhance my front-end development skills while creating an intuitive and interactive interface. The coordinates of the drawn path were uploaded to Firebase, providing a centralized storage solution. A robot, based on <!--more--> Arduino, retrieved, using bluetooth connected to a computer, the coordinates from Firebase and followed the same path in the physical world. This project improved my ability to integrate different technologies, such as web development and hardware communication, to create a seamless interaction between the virtual and real world. Additionally, I gained experience in data synchronization and real-time communication using Firebase.
