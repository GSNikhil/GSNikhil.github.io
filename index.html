                        I am a Master of Science student in Signal and Image Processing at UC San Diego with three years of experience in the CMOS Image Sensor Algorithm Team at Samsung Semiconductors India. 
                        My work there involved modeling hardware, developing compression schemes, and algorithms for sensors in Always-On (AON) mode. 
                        I was promoted within 1.5 years and awarded Employee-of-the-Month in May 2022 for my significant contributions.
                        <br><br>
                        I am passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact on the world, and I am actively seeking <b style="color: #e53935;">internships</b> in 
                        <b style="color: #e53935;"><i>hardware modelling, imaging, image/video compression, and computer vision</i></b>. I am confident that my strong technical skills, work experience, and academic achievements would make me a valuable asset to your team.

                        Viewing Bayer format images is a problem professional photographers and camera engineers face everyday. There are some tools which help solve the issue a bit. However, most of these solutions/tools are designed by the camera manufacturers and only support their own format(s). Viewing RAW images without header is a bigger issue and there are very few tools which have this feature.

                        An inherent problem with header-less RAW images is the fact that there is no information about the width and height. Formats like JPEG, PNG carry this information and thus it is very easy to view these images one after the other.

                        This tool was designed to overcome the above problem by asking the user the image dimensions before hand.

                        I admit, this tool solves a few problems, not all.
